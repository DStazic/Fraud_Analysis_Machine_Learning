#Identification of employee fraud

The goal of this project is to use machine learning and train a classifier to predict employee fraud. The main dataset consists of 2 subsets, namely financial assets and email communication.

final_project_dataset.pkl stores the financial dataset, whereas the email corpus can be downloaded from the Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/).

This project is still work in progress and will be updated accordingly
